# Data-Science---Iris-Dataset-Classification
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques on the well-known Iris dataset. The primary focus is on the implementation of classification algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

The following steps are performed:
	•	Data loading: The Iris dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets and pandas.
	•	Data exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset using pandas and seaborn for visualizing the distribution of features.
	•	Model building: Several classification models are implemented, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees.
	•	Model evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy metrics, and the best-performing model is selected.
	•	Visualization: Visualizations of the dataset and model results are created using seaborn.

Technologies used:
	•	Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn)
	•	Jupyter Notebooks

This project showcases basic skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification modeling, and data visualization, which are foundational skills for data science roles.
