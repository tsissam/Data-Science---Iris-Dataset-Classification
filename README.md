# Data-Science---Iris-Dataset-Classification
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques on the well-known Iris dataset. The primary focus is on the implementation of classification algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
